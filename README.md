# Taxi-demand-prediction-in-New-York-City
Time-series forecasting and Regression   - To find number of pickups, given location cordinates(latitude and longitude) and time, in the query reigion and surrounding regions. To solve the above we would be using data collected in Jan - Mar 2015 to predict the pickups in Jan - Mar 2016.

My Contribution : 

Task 1: Incorporate Fourier features as features into Regression models and measure MAPE. <br>

Task 2: Perform hyper-parameter tuning for Regression models.
